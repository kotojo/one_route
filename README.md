### This was made as demonstration of data flow through a mean stack application.

* You can follow through the application starting on the index.html with directions saying what will happened commented throughout.
* Each comment will direct you to the next location that the event will be triggered and explain what is happening.

* Install bower with `npm install -g bower`

5. `bower install` to install all bower dependencies
6. `cd ..` to go back to main directory
7. `node server/app.js` will start the server and run it at localhost:3000
